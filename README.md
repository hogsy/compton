# Compton, 2D Game Engine

Compton is a small open-source 2D game engine using Allegro 5 and written in C++.
It's purposefully designed to be simplistic with as few dependencies as possible.

If you decide to use it for anything [then I'd love to hear from you](mailto:hogsy@oldtimes-software.com)! ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Please note that while the main project itself is considered under GPL Version 3, 
the contents of the `bin/data/` directory is *not* considered under 
an open license, particularly as there may be temporary place-holder 
assets that I may not necessarily have copyright to, or assets that 
I've created myself that I would like to retain some semblence of 
ownership over.**

## Features
- Open-source! üòé
- Cross-platform, at least between Windows and Linux üêß
- There's an entity system! ‚ôüÔ∏è
- Serialization! üòä
- Profiling! üìä
- Allegro 5... ü§¢

*And now, a few caveats...*
- Rendering is done in software rather than hardware
- I've got no plans to support macOS

## Roadmap

- [ ] Remove dependence on Allegro 5 and replace it with SDL2
- [ ] Add support for using SDL2 as a backend, as opposed to Allegro 5

## Games

- [Virtual Creature](https://hogsy.itch.io/virtual-creature), for the [LOWREZJAM 2017](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017)
