# Compton, 2D Game Engine

Compton is an open-source 2D game engine using Allegro and written in C++.

It's important to note that I consider it **deprecated**, 
but I still sometimes use it for quick prototyping and thus I've decided to share it
on the off-chance someone might find it useful for something.
If you do decide to use it [then I'd love to hear from you](mailto:hogsy@oldtimes-software.com)! ❤️

Keep in mind it's also unlikely I'm going to be accepting contributions given I'm not going to be actively maintaining it.

## Features
- It's 2D! 😮
- It's open-source! 😎
- It's cross-platform! 🐧
- There's an entity system! ♟️
- Serialization! 😊
- Profiling! 📊
- Allegro 5... 🤢

*And now, a few caveats...*
- As of recently, for science, a lot of the rendering is done in software now
- There's a lot of unmaintained code left in here
- I'm not actively testing it on all three platforms, and don't really give a shit about supporting macOS anymore
- There's currently no editor of sorts
