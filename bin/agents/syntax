If you're reading this, awesome!

The scripting language is based heavily on the BASIC
programming language, and because of that it's incredibly
simple and easy to learn.

Below are a list of commands and what they do.

REGISTER <name>
    Registers the new actor with the actor factory.



REM <comment>
    This is a comment, everything after 'REM' will be
    ignored.

!<procedure>
    This declares a procedure.

RETURN <data, optional>
CALL <procedure>
    This calls a procedure. The return type of that
    procedure will be stored in A0.

INCLUDE <path>
    Includes another script alongside this one.
    Useful if you want to implement some generic functions
    to use everywhere rather than rewriting them out
    again and again.

An example script is provided below.

rem this is a comment

call myfunc
print A0

!myfunc
let var=3
print var
var = var + 3
print var
return var
