If you're reading this, awesome!

The scripting language is based heavily on the BASIC
programming language, and because of that it's incredibly
simple and easy to learn.

Below are a list of commands and what they do.

PROC <procedure>
    This declares a procedure.

ABS <number>
    Returns the absolute value of number.

ACS <number>
    Returns the arc cosine of number.

ASN <number>
    Returns the arc size of number.

COS <number>
    Returns the cosine of number.

LEN <string>
    Returns the number of characters in string.

VAR <variable> = <value>
    Assigns value to the named variable.

REG <name>
    Registers the new actor with the actor factory.

REM <comment>
    This is a comment, everything after 'REM' will be
    ignored.

RETURN <data, optional>
CALL <procedure>
    This calls a procedure. The return type of that
    procedure will be stored in A0.

MERGE <path>
    Includes another script alongside this one.
    Useful if you want to implement some generic functions
    to use everywhere rather than rewriting them out
    again and again.

PRINT <message>
    Prints out a message, useful for debugging.

An example script is provided below.

rem this is a comment

call myfunc
print A0

!myfunc
let var=3
print var
var = var + 3
print var
return var
